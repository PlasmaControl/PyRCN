What is Reservoir Computing?
============================

Reservoir Computing is a paradigm for a fast one-shot training of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). As an umbrella topic, 
the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which is a feed-forward network, can also belong to Reservoir Computing, because the training paradigm is similar.

The `Scholarpedia article about Echo State Networks <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_state_network>`_ give an excellent introduction to the topic.

Many examples can be found in the PyRCN repository.
Some useful examples can also be found in the `PyRCN repository <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/PyRCN/tree/master/examples>`_ with many Jupyter notebooks.
