Tutorials
=========

We have prepared a collection of Jupyter (IPython) notebooks that show how to use the package.

You can view them online or download Python scripts:

The notebook `PyRCN_Intro <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/PyRCN/blob/main/examples/PyRCN_Intro.ipynb>`_ or its corresponding `Python script <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/PyRCN/blob/main/examples/PyRCN_Intro.py>`_ show how to construct different RCNs with building blocks.

The notebook `Impulse responses <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/PyRCN/blob/main/examples/esn_impulse_responses.ipynb>`_ is an interactive tool to demonstrate the impact of different hyper-parameters on the impulse responses of an ESN.

The Jupyter notebook `digits <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/PyRCN/blob/main/examples/digits.ipynb>`_ or its corresponding `Python script <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/PyRCN/blob/main/examples/digits.py>`_ show how to set up an ESN for a small hand-written digit recognition experiment.

Fore more advanced examples, please have a look at our `Automatic Music Transcription Repository <https://github.com/TUD-STKS/Automatic-Music-Transcription>`_, 
in which we provide an entire feature extraction, training and test pipeline for multipitch tracking and for note onset detection using PyRCN. This is currently transferred to this repository.
